# Vamp Linux Host

This is the small Linux companion for terminal sessions. It provides a
loopback-only browser workspace with task-chat and terminal presentations,
multiple PTYs, one-time pairing approval, long-lived per-browser tokens,
resize, clipboard messages, safe workspace roots, and a maximum of eight
terminals per browser connection.

It is intentionally independent from the macOS WebRTC host. The macOS products
(`Vamp Host` and `Vamp Terminal Host`) use the signed pairing/WebRTC stack used
by the iOS app. The Linux companion uses a dependency-free WebSocket endpoint so
a browser can control Linux without Vamp Control or Vamp Terminal. Those apps
cannot attach here. This keeps the Linux install small
and makes the network boundary obvious.

## Install

Download and extract the latest Linux archive, then run:

```sh
./install.sh
```

This installs the host under `~/.local/lib/vamp-terminal-host`, creates the
`~/.local/bin/vamp-terminal-host` command, and installs an optional user-level
systemd service. No root access is required.

Start it interactively:

```sh
vamp-terminal-host
```

Or enable it at login on systemd-based desktops:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now vamp-terminal-host.service
```

## Run from source

```sh
python3 linux-host/vamp_terminal_host.py
```

Open the printed local URL, enter the six-digit code shown in the host
terminal, then use the tab bar. The browser keeps the resulting paired token
for its 30-day lifetime, so refreshing the page reconnects without another
code. For private tailnet access, keep the process bound to loopback and run:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:9475
```

If Tailscale is not available, a named Cloudflare Tunnel also works because
the host speaks HTTP/1.1 for reverse-proxy WebSocket upgrades. Keep the tunnel
behind a Cloudflare Access policy; do not use an unauthenticated quick tunnel
for this terminal surface.

Create a tunnel ingress that targets the loopback listener:

```yaml
# ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_UUID>
credentials-file: /home/<you>/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_UUID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: vamp.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:9475
  - service: http_status:404
```

Then start the configured tunnel and open its hostname from an authorized
device:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel run vamp-terminal
```

Cloudflare Tunnel forwards the browser's WebSocket connection as well as the
pairing request. If the hostname is protected by Cloudflare Access, complete
that sign-in first, then enter the six-digit Vamp pairing code.

Do not bind this process to a public interface or use port forwarding. The
pairing code is a short-lived bearer credential, not an account or identity
system.

## Options

```text
--listen 127.0.0.1       Bind address (loopback by default)
--allow-non-loopback     Required before --listen on a non-loopback address
--port 9475              Browser service port
--max-terminals 8        Per-connection PTY limit, capped at 8
```

Agent sessions can be created from the host shell with `tmux` or `screen`, then
attached through a tab. Each browser tab can switch between Chat and Terminal.
Enter `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, or `gemini` once in Chat to select an
installed provider. Subsequent messages use that provider's documented
non-interactive JSON stream and continue the same provider session. Each CLI
must already be installed and authenticated for the Linux user running the
host. Linux semantic Chat does not add a provider's unsafe approval-bypass
flags; use Terminal for interactive approval flows.

Shell submissions still use a bounded, command-scoped projection; startup
banners, interactive TUI redraws, and raw ANSI controls stay in Terminal. The
browser client also supports Ctrl-C, Escape, Tab, arrows, resize messages, copy
output, and paste. PTY output is transported as base64 bytes and decoded
incrementally in the browser so split UTF-8 characters are not corrupted.

## Current capability boundary

The Linux companion provides terminal tabs, semantic Chat for Claude Code,
Codex CLI, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI, command-scoped shell Chat, clipboard,
resize, and workspace selection. Structured task plans, adapters for
interactive-only agent CLIs, and remote desktop remain unsupported. Use the
macOS Vamp Host when those features are required.
